# Form Testing (Compatibility Alias)

Use the canonical skill:
- `../opendevbrowser-form-testing/SKILL.md`

Run the canonical scripts:

```bash
./skills/opendevbrowser-form-testing/scripts/validate-skill-assets.sh
./skills/opendevbrowser-form-testing/scripts/run-form-workflow.sh validation
```

Compatibility notes:
- This alias remains for legacy prompts/tooling only.
- Keep all form workflow updates in `opendevbrowser-form-testing`.
