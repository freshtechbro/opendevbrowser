# Local AGENTS.md (docs/)

Applies to `docs/` and subdirectories. Extends root `AGENTS.md`.

## Documentation Architecture
- `docs/` is the source of truth for plans, blueprints, and architecture alignment.
- Keep architecture, remediation, and plan docs synchronized with implementation changes.

## Documentation Rules
- Keep plan docs in sync with the current scope.
- Update architecture docs when architecture changes.
- Prefer linking to the canonical doc instead of duplicating guidance.
- Use Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams.
- Keep docs concise, ASCII, and action-oriented.
