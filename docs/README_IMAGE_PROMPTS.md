- Core workflow to visualize: Snapshot -> Refs -> Actions
- Technical motifs: Chrome DevTools protocol, relay/extension bridge, stable refs, multi-tab control

## Visual Direction
- Mood: modern, technical, trustworthy, high-contrast
- Avoid: cartoon styles, purple-heavy palettes, overly busy scenes
- Preferred ratio: `16:9` for GitHub README hero/banner usage

## Palette Anchors (from current assets)
- Deep background navy: `#060910`, `#0b1220`, `#0d1524`
- Primary accents: `#20d5c6` (teal), `#6ee7ff` (cyan)
- Supporting tones: `#e8edf6` (light text), `#9aa6bd` (muted)
- Sparse highlights: `#f6c56f` (amber), `#f16b4e` (coral)

## Candidate Prompts

### Candidate 1 — Cinematic Workflow Hero
Create a polished cinematic hero illustration for an AI browser automation project. Show a modern desktop browser interface in dark mode with subtle accessibility nodes and reference markers floating over UI elements, plus directional motion cues that imply "snapshot to refs to actions". Visual style: high-end product marketing illustration, clean and technical, not cartoon. Palette: deep navy background (#060910, #0b1220), teal/cyan glows (#20d5c6, #6ee7ff), small amber highlights (#f6c56f). Add atmospheric depth with gradients and soft volumetric light. No text, no logos, no watermark.

### Candidate 2 — Relay Architecture Isometric
Create an isometric technical illustration of an AI agent controlling a browser through a secure local relay bridge. Show three connected zones: agent terminal, relay/extension layer, and active browser tab with interactive elements. Use elegant data-flow lines and small node indicators to communicate reliable automation. Style: sleek, minimal, enterprise-devtool marketing graphic. Color direction: dark navy surfaces with teal/cyan signal paths and subtle coral warning accents. No text labels. No logos. No watermark.

### Candidate 3 — Snapshot Refs Actions Abstract System
Design an abstract but readable systems illustration representing "Snapshot -> Refs -> Actions" as three stages connected left-to-right. Use layered panels, accessibility-tree style branching, and clickable target markers. Keep composition wide and balanced for a README banner. Style: clean geometric, modern SaaS/devtools branding. Colors: deep blue-black base, bright cyan/teal accents, cool light-gray support tones, minimal amber highlight points. No text, no letters, no watermark.

### Candidate 4 — Annotation + Automation Scene
Generate a developer-focused scene showing a browser page with annotation overlays, highlighted DOM regions, sticky note markers, and a command panel driving automated actions. The visual should communicate precise UI interaction and debugging with AI assistance. Keep it sophisticated, crisp, and product-ready. Color palette should match dark navy + cyan/teal accents from modern devtools UIs, with tiny amber/coral details for status contrast. No text, no brand names, no watermark.

### Candidate 5 — Futuristic Control Surface
Create a futuristic but practical control-surface illustration for browser automation: multiple web panels, tab cards, and UI element refs connected by luminous lines to an AI orchestration core. Emphasize precision, stability, and speed. Style: premium technical concept art with restrained detail and clean composition suitable for open-source README branding. Palette anchored in deep midnight blues and aqua-cyan highlights, avoiding purple dominance. No text, no logos, no watermark.
